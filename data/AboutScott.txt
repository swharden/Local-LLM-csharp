Scott William Harden is an open-source software developer. He is the primary author of ScottPlot, pyabf, FftSharp, Spectrogram, and several other open-source packages. Scott’s favorite color is dark blue despite the fact that he is colorblind. Scott’s advocacy for those with color vision deficiency (CVD) leads him to recommend perceptually uniform color maps like Viridis instead of traditional color maps like Spectrum and Jet.
